# photofy

Welcome to Photofy! Photofy is a photo album app that allows user to upload an image and choose if they want the image to be "public" and shared with
others or "private" for another place to store pictures. Photofy was created using Python's Django framework and his deployed through railway.app.

When you first enter the site, you are greeted with a login form that prompts the user to enter their username and password. If the user doesn't have an
account, they can follow the link at the bottom that says, "Don't have an account?"

That link then directs the user to the registration page that prompts the user to create an account and enter their preferred username, email address and
preffered password with a password confirmation. Once the user has entered in their information and pressed "Create Account", the user is then directed to
the homepage of the site. There is also a link at the bottom that says, "Already have an account?" that directs the user back to the login page.

Once the user is logged in, they are directed to the homepage of the site which shows all of the user's images that they have uploaded, both private and 
public photos. There is also a form for uploading new images that directs the user to add a title, choose the image and select whether the image is private 
or public.

Once the image has been added, the image will appear next to the photo upload form.

The user can then view the image better by hovering over the image or they can click the image itself and be directed to another page to view the photo's 
information.

On this page, the user is able to view the photo's information, title, image link and privacy status, and the user has the option to update any information on the picture or they have the option to delete the photo completely.

To be directed back to the homepage, the title "Photofy" can also be used as a button to direct the user back to the homepage.

In order to view other users' pictures, the "explore" button next to the "logout" button in the navigation bar directs user to another page that hosts all
images that have a privacy setting of "public".

The explore page shares all photos that have been uploaded that have a privacy setting of public. The image also shows which user uploaded the image and
their username is a link that directs the user to that user's profile/page.

Once the user is directed to another user's page, they are able to view that user's photos that are "public". The photos also include the title of the 
image that the user added for said image.

Once the user is done uploading photos or viewing other users' photos, the "logout" button in the navbar logs the user out, clearing the browser's session and directing the user back to the login screen.
