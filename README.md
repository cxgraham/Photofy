Welcome to Photofy! Photofy is a photo album app that allows user to upload an image and choose if they want the image to be "public" and shared with
others or "private" for another place to store pictures. Photofy was created using Python's Django framework and his deployed through railway.app.

When you first enter the site, you are greeted with a login form that prompts the user to enter their username and password. If the user doesn't have an
account, they can follow the link at the bottom that says, "Don't have an account?"

That link then directs the user to the registration page that prompts the user to create an account and enter their preferred username, email address and
preffered password with a password confirmation. Once the user has entered in their information and pressed "Create Account", the user is then directed to
the homepage of the site. There is also a link at the bottom that says, "Already have an account?" that directs the user back to the login page.

Once the user is logged in, they are directed to the homepage of the site which shows all of the user's images that they have uploaded, both private and 
public photos. There is also a form for uploading new images that directs the user to add a title, choose the image and select whether the image is private 
or public.
